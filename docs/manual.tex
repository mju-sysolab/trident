\section{Introduction}
Trident is an high-level language (HLL) compiler for scientific
algorithms written in C that use float and double data types.  It
produces circuits in reconfigurable logic that exploit the
micro-instruction and pipelined parallelism.  Trident automatically
extracts parallelism and pipelines loop bodies using compiler
optimizations and hardware scheduling techniques.  The Trident
compiler consists of four principal steps shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:overview}.

The first step in the Trident compilation process is the LLVM C/C++
front-end.  The LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) compiler
framework\cite{lattner04llvm} is used to parse input languages, and
produce a low-level platform independent object code.  LLVM optimizes
the object code and then Trident parses the result into its own
intermediate representation (IR).  This approach allows Trident to
concern itself with hardware compilation and leave the parsing and
baseline optimizations in LLVM.

The Trident compiler's second step, IR transformation, accomplishes
several important tasks.  First, operations are converted into
predicated form to allow the creation of hyperblocks.  Next, further
optimizations are performed to remove any unnecessary operations.
Finally, all floating point operations are mapped into a specific
hardware library selected by the user.

Floating point data types, with 32- or 64-bit width, present
challenges in terms of resource allocation, both on- and off-chip.
Floating point modules require significantly more logic blocks on a
reconfigurable chip than small integer operations.  The large input
width also implies that more memory bandwidth is required for floating
point arrays. Scheduling is further complicated by the interaction
with resource allocation.  The operations will be scheduled with one
of four different scheduling algorithms: ASAP, ALAP, Force Directed,
and for pipelined loops, Iterative Modulo scheduling.

The final step synthesizes the results of the scheduler into Register
Transfer Level (RTL) VHDL.  Hierarchy is utilized in the hardware
description in order to preserve modularity.  The top-level circuit
contains subcircuits for each block in the control flow graph input
and also a single register file.  The register file is shared by all
block subcircuits.  Each block subcircuit contains a state machine and
a datapath subcircuit.  The state machine is determined by the
initiation interval of the design, and it controls the timing of the
block's datapath.  The datapath implements the logic needed to
represent the flow of data through all of the operations found in the
control flow graph.  It contains operators, predicate logic, local
registers and wires that connect all of the components.  All of these
elements combine to produce a highly optimized application specific
circuit.

Trident provides an open framework for exploration of floating-point
libraries and computation in FPGAs.  The Trident framework allows for
user optimizations to be added at several levels of abstraction.
Users can trade-off clock speed and latency through their selection of
different floating-point libraries and optimizations.  It is also
possible for users to import their own floating point libraries.  New
hardware platforms may be added by defining new interface description
files and producing the code to tie the design to the description
interface.
